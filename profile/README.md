# :ledger: Overview : 
**"A quiet regenerative evolution"** Why have we chosen that byline?

**Regenerative** adjective (IMPROVING) - Relating to the improvement of a place or system, especially by making it more active or successful, or to making a person feel happier and more positive: - Cambridge dictionary

**Evolution** is a process of continuous branching and diversification from common trunks. This pattern of irreversible separation gives life's history its basic directionality. ‚Äî Stephen Jay Gould

**Do we really need an evolution of the food system?**

If your answer is yes, then get on board and help us launch a global, multi-lingual food systems mobile application for consumers, producers and complimentary suppliers. It's designed for anyone who produces food and related products, consumes food and related products and anyone who supplies services or related products to complete the cycle between consumers and producers. It's geared for people who want freedom of choice in what they consume and what they produce. It's for people who want to be part of the transformation we most definitely need for the coming years.

If you're still sceptical, let's start with a few questions... and let's apply the Qui Bono (to whom is it a benefit?) principle.

If the food you eat makes you sick, who benefits? If local regenerative farms are stifled and big ag promoted, who benefits? If policies and regulations threaten the livelyhoods of local farmers, who benefits? We could go on and on with this but you get the drift. Try it yourself with ANY of the measures introduced by the policy makers.

That being said, many aspects of the global food system are failing.  The current power structures don't seem willing or able to provide solutions at all. Is this intentional? Or, is it the result of bloated, incompetent governance that lacks capacity to perform? 
Whatever the reasons, the crisis is here and steadily getting worse. 

We, the many, have the power to change the way we do things and erode the power of systems presently in play.

How, you ask? And where do we begin?

One of our goals is to help people easily manage the production of healthy, nutritious food while offering simple and convenient access to it. 
Another is to make it free to use while offering everyone a way to easily participate in regenerating their environment. 

We've set in motion three phases for this evolution, the first of which is the mobile application, now ready for the open-source community and designed specifically with basic principals to meet these goals. It's an alternative which runs parallel to our current system, built to nurture ancient wisdom for living in harmony with the naturally abundant, infinite value our planet offers. 

On the surface, Source it Fresh may appear to be just another "Farm to Fork". Under the skin, it's a lot more! 
It's geared to encourage and enable localised production and consumption, reducing wasteful practices. It's built with freedom of choice for collaboration and voluntary sharing of production data (anonomously) between participating producers and suppliers, promoting better production outcomes and transparency for consumers. It's suitable for anyone with a mobile or desktop device who wants to produce, source or broadcast products including delivery and payment options. It's also designed to cater for those who only want basic functions all the way through to those who want to measure progress from soil microbiome to nutritional value of mature plant. 

And, it's all on one platform where knowledge, convenience, accessibility, value stability and trade all combine to allow for consistent supply/demand conditions, improved redundancy and most importantly, resilience against manipulation and centralised control (further detail available in our paper).

It's also engineered to include everyone who wants to participate and doesn't restrict anyone because of their location, status, ethnicity, or age. Source it Fresh is not political, religious, racial nor genderist. There is no built-in mechanism to observe, manipulate or apply thought control. It‚Äôs a "soil-up" movement where people have the choice to decide how and why they engage, promote transparency, build trust and offer accountability.

If you're still unsure about getting involved, drop us a note. We'll try to respond as quickly as we can.

## :sunrise: Next Steps : 
To date, SiF has been internally funded. Our capacity to launch and grow this project without external funding and contributors will be limited. While there are funding models that could be deployed, and many have been discussed at length, they have their own pitfalls, and we see limitations to growth in the poorest regions and territories where SiF could be most influential.
Future development of the platform from participants anywhere on the planet, also requires that we attract funding that is absolutely cross-border in nature.
